# KNN_ML
Within this repository, Jupyter notebooks are provided for the exploration of the optimal choice of the k constant (neighbors).

## Results 
The performance of the machine learning model is variably influenced by different k values. Generally, a higher k value facilitates simpler decision-making but at the cost of reduced accuracy. Conversely, a lower k value enhances accuracy but may complicate decision-making. Determining the optimal k value is best achieved through experimentation, as a single value is unlikely to be universally effective across all models.
